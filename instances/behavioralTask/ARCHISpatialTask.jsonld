  "description": "[extracted from Phino et al. 2018] The 'ARCHI Spatial task' examins functions involved in spatial cognition. The paradigm is structured in blocks and it comprises five block categories. Each block is formed by a set of trials containing an event, in which visual instructions are displayed that relate to one or two conditions of the same kind. These five categories of blocks are characterized as follows: (1) saccade, in which ocular movements is performed according to the displacement of a fixation cross from the center toward peripheral locations in the image displayed; (2) imitation of object grasping with the right hand, in which the corresponding object is displayed on the screen; (3) mimic orientation of rhombus, displayed as image background on the screen, using the right hand; events of block categories 2 and 3 featured the same visual stimuli, in order to capture grasping-specific activity; (4) judgment on the left/right orientation of a hand displayed as visual stimulus; and (5) judgment on the palmar/dorsal direction of a hand displayed as visual stimulus. Events of block categories 4 and 5 feature the same visual stimuli. The task is constituted by forty blocks per run. The order of blocks presentation is pseudo-randomized for the session, but fixed for all participants. Each block is composed by either three or four trials. The duration of the trials ranges between 1.2 and 1.8\u2009s. All blocks are inter-spaced by a fixation-cross period with a duration between four and six seconds.",
