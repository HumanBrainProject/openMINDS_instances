  "definition": "In the 'HCP Language Processing task' participants are presented with a two-alternative forced-choice question about the topic of a brief story they previoulsy had to listen to. The task is included in the Human Connectome Project.",
  "description": "The HCP language task was developed by Binder and colleagues (Binder et al. 2011) and uses the E-prime scripts provided by these investigators. The task consists of two runs that each interleave 4 blocks of a story task and 4 blocks of a math task. The lengths of the blocks vary (average of approximately 30 seconds), but the task was designed so that the math task blocks match the length of the story task blocks, with some additional math trials at the end of the task to complete the 3.8 minute run as needed. The story blocks present participants with brief auditory stories (5-9 sentences) adapted from Aesop\u2019s fables, followed by a 2-alternative forced-choice question that asks participants about the topic of the story. The example provided in the original Binder paper (p. 1466) is \u201cFor example, after a story about an eagle that saves a man who had done him a favor, participants were asked, \u201cWas that about revenge or reciprocity?\u201d The math task also presents trials auditorially and requires subjects to complete addition and subtraction problems. The trials present subjects with a series of arithmetic operations (e.g., \u201cfourteen plus twelve\u201d), followed by \u201cequals\u201d and then two choices (e.g., \u201ctwenty-nine or twenty-six\u201d). Participants push a button to select either the first or the second answer. The math task is adaptive to try to maintain a similar level of difficulty across participants. For more details on the task, please see (Binder et al. 2011).",
