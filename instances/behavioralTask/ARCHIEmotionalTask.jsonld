  "description": "[extracted from Phino et al. 2018] The 'ARCHI Emotional task' intends to investigate cognitive-emotional processes on perception of faces and expressions. The paradigm is arranged in blocks that comprise sets of trials. Two categories of conditions can be highlighted from the paradigm: (1) the face-task category and (2) the eye-task category. Both categories involve self-reply according to the stimulus presented at every condition. The face-task category consists in the presentation of human faces, whereas the eye-task category is dedicated to images representing human eyes. For the face-task category, two conditions correspond to the evaluation of gender and trustworthiness of the human faces. In the eye-task category, the two homologous conditions refer to gender and emotion-expression evaluation. The task concerning emotion expression in the latter category is in accordance with a cue given immediately before the image display. Besides the two categories, there is also a baseline condition, showing a gray-scale grid image that may be tilted or not. To achieve the intended goal of this condition, a mental assessment about the orientation of the image has to be performed. The task consists of twelve blocks per run, and every block comprises between two and four trials. The order of trials presentation is pseudo-randomized for the session, but fixed for all participants. The trials lasts about 6.3â€‰s. A fixation-cross period of approximately one second is presented between blocks.",
