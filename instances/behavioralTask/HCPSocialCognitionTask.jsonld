  "definition": "In the 'HCP Social Cognition task' participants had to judge whether in a video clip moving objects (i) 'mentally' interacted with eachother, (ii) moved randomly on a screen, (iii) it was unclear if they interacted or not. The task is included in the Human Connectome Project.",
  "description": "In the 'HCP Social Cognition task' participants were presented with short video clips (20 seconds) of objects (squares, circles, triangles) that either interacted in some way, or moved randomly on the screen. All presented videos were developed by either Castelli and colleagues (Castelli et al. 2000) or Martin and colleagues (Wheatley et al. 2007). After each video clip, participants judge whether (i) the objects had a mental interaction (an interaction that appears as if the shapes are taking into account each other\u2019s feelings and thoughts), (ii) the objects had no interaction (i.e., there is no obvious interaction between the shapes and the movement appears random), or (iii) it was unclear if they interacted or not. The task consists of two runs. Each of the two task runs has 5 video blocks (2 Mental and 3 Random in one run, 3 Mental and 2 Random in the other run) and 5 fixation blocks (15 seconds each).",
