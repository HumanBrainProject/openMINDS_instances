  "definition": "In the 'ARCHI Standard task' participants conduct 10 task conditions in a fast event-related paradigm.",
  "description": "[extracted from Phino et al. 2018] The 'ARCHI Standard task' includs a variety of elementary cognitive functions, ranging from perceptual processing to high-cognition. The task is organized as a fast event-related paradigm, composed of trials of ten different conditions: (1) left-hand three-times button press, indicated by visual instruction; (2) right-hand three-times button press, indicated by visual instruction; (3) left-hand three-times button press, indicated by auditory instruction; (4) right-hand three-times button press, indicated by auditory instruction; (5) listen to narrative sentences; (6) read narrative sentences; (7) viewing of flashing horizontal checkerboards; (8) viewing of flashing vertical checkerboards; (9) silent subtraction, indicated by visual instruction; and (10) silent subtraction, indicated by auditory instruction. The task comprises eighty trials in one single run. There are two runs within the same session, in which two different sequences of trials are presented. The sequence of trials per run are pseudo-randomized for the session, but fixed for all participants. The duration of the trials ranged between two and four seconds. There were twenty two epochs of rest between trials, in which a fixation cross is displayed. A complete description of the paradigm is available in Pinel et al. 2007.",
