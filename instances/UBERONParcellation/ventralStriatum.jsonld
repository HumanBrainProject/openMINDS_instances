It includes the nucleus accumbens, the most ventral portions of the caudate nucleus and the putamen, the rostrolateral portion of the anterior perforated substance, the islands of Calleja and a rostral subcommissural portion of substantia innominata. The boundary between the ventral striatum and dorsal striatum is indistinct in sections stained for Nissl substance (Heimer-1995; adapted from Brain Info).",
