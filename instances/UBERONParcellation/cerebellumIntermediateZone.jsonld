  "definition": "The paired regions of the cerebellar hemisphere that lie adjacent to the vermis and are between the vermis and lateral regions of the hemispheres; it receives input from the corticopontocerebellar fibers that originate from the motor cortex, and also receives sensory feedback from the muscles; these signals are integrated by this region, to coordinate muscle activity with motor inputs.",
